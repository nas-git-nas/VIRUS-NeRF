## Abstract
This research strives to leverage cost-effective sensors for local mapping applications in mobile robotics. 
The study introduces _VIRUS-NeRF_ - _Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields_. 
While traditional mapping techniques often rely on expensive sensors like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or 
RGB-D cameras, _VIRUS-NeRF_ integrates low-cost sensors while using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for scene representation. 
By exhaustive sensor analysis and testing, the URM37 could be identified as the optimal ultrasonic sensor (USS). 
Building upon _Instant Neural Graphics Primitives_ (_Instant-NGP_), _VIRUS-NeRF_ incorporates 
depth measurements from USSs and infrared sensors (IRSs) and advances the occupancy grid utilized for ray marching. 
Experimental evaluation conducted at ETHZ demonstrates that _VIRUS-NeRF_ achieves comparable mapping 
performance to LiDAR point clouds in terms of coverage, and surpasses USS and IRS scans. Notably, in environments with 
optimized parameters, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in less optimized settings, it 
exhibits performance akin to USSs. Through an in-depth ablation study, three key factors of NeRF-based mapping are identified: 

* Utilizing _Instant-NGP_ for mapping yields poor results. The assistance of the camera with depth sensors is imperative
given the sparse measurements typical in mobile robotics.
* The proposed occupancy grid in _VIRUS-NeRF_ augments mapping performance and training efficiency. 
* Optimization of the large hyper-parameter space via particle swarm optimization and refinement of poses through bundle
adjustment enhances accuracy.

Limitations such as accuracy constraints, hyper-parameter generalization issues, and convergence speed are discussed and 
accompanied by possible solutions. Overall, _VIRUS-NeRF_ presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping 
in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.
